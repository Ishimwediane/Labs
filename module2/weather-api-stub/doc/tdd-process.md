# TDD Process

The project follows the Red → Green → Refactor workflow.

## Red Phase
- Write a failing test for the feature before any implementation.

## Green Phase
- Write the minimum code needed to pass the test.

## Refactor Phase
- Improve code readability and structure without changing functionality.

## Git Commits
- Each phase is reflected in the commit history:
  - `test: add failing test for get_forecast`
  - `feat: implement minimal code for get_forecast`
  - `refactor: clean service logic`
