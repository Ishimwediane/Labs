# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project is a mock Weather API service built using a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow. 
It simulates weather data for predefined cities and raises custom exceptions for invalid inputs.

## Scope
- Provide weather forecasts for known cities.
- Raise errors for unknown cities or invalid API keys.
- Designed for developers to test integration without a real API.

## Key Features
- Predefined weather data for a set of cities
- Custom exception handling
- Structured logging
- Fully tested using pytest with mocks and fixtures
